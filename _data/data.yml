        I am a first year PhD student of computer science, under the supervision of Dr. Guanpeng Li. My research mainly lies in system dependability, which
        focuses on fault tolerant computer system.
    - university: BSc in Computer Science & Engineering

      details: |
        In my undergrad years, I was involved in problem solving, programming contest and hackathons . I participated numerous intra-university, NCPC, ICPC preliminary
        contests. I've had a decent <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/mHr029" style="color:#F08080;">codeforces</a> participation.

        + Worked under Professor <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=kaykobad" style="color:#F08080;">Dr. M. Kaykobad</a>
        + Proposed a modification in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0020019075900563" style="color:#F08080;">Yao's</a> algorithm  
          Yao used medians of median finding <a href="http://bioinfo.ict.ac.cn/~dbu/AlgorithmCourses/Lectures/Lec15-Selection-Methods-Floyd-Reviest-Blum.pdf" style="color:#F08080;">algorithm</a> to preprocess the adjacency
          list of each node in a graph. This preprocessing reduces runtime significantly. Then he used familiar <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1380895/Otakar_Boruvka_1899_1995_and_the_Minimum_Spanning_Tree" style="color:#F08080;">Boruvka</a> algorithm 
          to construct minimum spanning tree. The main idea here was number of components be reduced by at least factor two, as an edge weight can be minimum from
          both side in the worst case. I detected this area as a possible improvement option. I tried to improve the fact that whether it is possible to do reduction by at least factor three. My idea was to check an edge being minimum from both components. If it is the case, then we can add another second
          minimum edge to one of these components at the same step. Thus number of components could be reduced by at least factor three.

        I am working here in an iOS project named MCPTT. It is a USA project. I am involved in developments of several modules here. One of the major modules I've implemented is Affiliation, a feature
        by which an user can mute a group if s/he doesn't want to be notified for that group events. This feature is similar to facebook messenger group mute option. This feature uses SIP protocol for communicating
        with server.
